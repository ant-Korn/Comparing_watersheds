# Computational resources comparison of watershed algorithm implementations 

This project is a set of scripts providing the ability to compare execution time and maximum memory of the watershed algorithm implementations, which are presented in the different image processing libraries.

## The papers

In the folder [2018](./2018) we provide scripts that used for results presentation in the following paper: 
> Kornilov AS, Safonov IV. An Overview of Watershed Algorithm Implementations in Open Source Libraries. Journal of Imaging. 2018; 4(10):123. https://doi.org/10.3390/jimaging4100123

In the folder [2022](./2022) we provide scripts that used for resources estimation of volumetric images segmentation.
